### This is the project for Mini Data Analysis project for Johnson Chen. 

The purpose of this repository is to record me working on a mini data analysis on a specific dataset for STAT 545A, manipulate and summarize the data in tibbles, with a research question in mind.

### The files included in this repository

There are three main folders and two files in milestone 1 + 2 release:
1. mini-project-1_files: This is the folder storing the files used in milestone 1
2. mini-project-1.md: This is the markdown file generated from the Rmarkdown file by knitting. Please see this file if you want to see the outcome of the project in a human-readable format.
3. README.md: This is the file you are reading now. This file includes the introduction of this repository and how you should approach this.
4. mini-project-1_files: This directory contains all the plots generated by the Rmarkdown file using ggplot. They are references for the markdown file to use, and removing them would remove the plots in your readable file.
